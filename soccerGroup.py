# Women's Soccer Season
# Description: This program will simulate a season for a women's soccer team. It will store information in a dictionary by asking about a home womenâ€™s soccer team, how many games they will play, and the name of the teams they will play. It will randomly generate scores for each game and determine if the home team won or lost. The program will then display the scores for each game, the final season record, and a message based on the record.
